# Chromatic-Motion-Blur

Inspired on : https://twitter.com/ippsketch/status/1382703022875291650

The main pourpose was to remove the dust on my brain, and have some fun trying to reproduce that blur + chromatic aberration effects.
Works 100% with css, the javascript code only changes css variables values to modify the amplitude, and the animation time.
